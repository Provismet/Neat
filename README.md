# Neat
Functional minimalistic Unit Frames for the modern Minecrafter

## Provi's Fork
This fork aims to mostly implement mobstacking in Neat.

- Non-Living passengers (looking at you, Monumenta splash-potion creepers) no longer block a mob's healthbar from rendering.
- Mobstacks (mobs riding each other) will show a combined HP total (does not affect the health bar).
  - Do not ask me to add this information to the health bars. I don't know rendering works in regular Fabric, let alone this alien Xplat Forge/Fabric combined workspace with different function names.
